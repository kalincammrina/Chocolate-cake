 Chocolate cake is a cake flavored with melted chocolate, cocoa powder.
A layered Chocolate Cake never goes out of style. Trends may come and go but a Chocolate Cake is as popular today as it was 10, 20, or 75 years ago. This Simple Chocolate Cake is especially appealing both for the baker and for those who get to enjoy this cake. I find that most bakers are always on the lookout for a cake recipe that can be made really quickly yet doesn't sacrifice texture and flavor. This Simple Chocolate Cake recipe is just that. The batter can be made, and the cakes in the oven, within 15 minutes. Yet, it produces a cake with great chocolate flavor a deliciously soft and moist texture. While you could frost this cake with any flavor of frosting, my favorite is this buttery smooth chocolate fudge frosting. Because I find there is nothing better than a double dose of chocolate to make everyone feel better.
